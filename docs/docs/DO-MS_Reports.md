# Distribution plots of SCoPE2 data:

To facilitate the exploration of the SCoPE2 data, we plotted the distributions of important and informative features of the LC-MS/MS data using the methodology of [Data-driven Optimization of MS (DO-MS)](https://do-ms.slavovlab.net) developed by Huffman, et al., _J. of Proteome Research_, 2019, DOI: [10.1021/acs.jproteome.9b00039](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jproteome.9b00039)

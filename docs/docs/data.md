* [Peptides-raw.csv](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1c9fwYI4qf9LzaQHf0wXoYAr2fuqNhNll)
  - `Peptides` **x** `single cells` at 1% FDR.  The first 2 columns list the corresponding protein identifiers and peptide sequences and each subsequent column corresponds to a single cell. Peptide identification is based on spectra analyzed by [MaxQuant](https://www.maxquant.org/)  and is enhanced by using [DART-ID](https://dart-id.slavovlab.net/) to incorporate retention time information. See [Specht et al., 2019](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/665307v3) for details.   

&nbsp;

* [Proteins-processed.csv](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1c5Z3b_2gOwDyHCLm9ycY3hXckY1GDd5L)
   - `Proteins` **x** `single cells` at 1% FDR, imputed and batch corrected.

&nbsp;

* [Cells.csv](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1c0nUlgQN1CjeWMZGjC_bTmcAe-e9rfaT)
   - `Annotation` **x**  `single cells`. Each column corresponds to a single cell and the rows include relevant metadata, such as, cell type if known, measurements from the isolation of the cell, and derivative quantities, i.e., rRI, CVs, reliability.

&nbsp;

* [Joint protein-RNA data](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1bzLv2h6A91CtWMc73rKZrZGmyHP5c4B5)
   - `Gene` **x**  `single cells`. Boths sets imputed and batch-corrected separately then combined, taking only genes common to both data sets. Uniprot accession numbers used to denote gene.

<h2 style="letter-spacing: 2px; font-size: 26px;" id="RAW-single-cell-protein-data" >SCoPE2 RAW data and search results from MaxQuant</h2>
The repositories below contain RAW mass-spectrometry data files generated by a Q exactive instruments as well as the search results from analyzing the  RAW files by [MaxQuant](https://www.maxquant.org/)  and by [DART-ID](https://dart-id.slavovlab.net/). The files in Repository 1 were generated in the spring of 2019 and described in the first version of [Specht et al., 2019](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/665307v2). The files in Repository 2 were generated in the fall of 2019 from biological replicates and are described in the third version of [Specht et al., 2019](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/665307v3). The data in Repository 1 were generated with 11-plex TMT while data in Repository 2 were generated with 16-plex TMT pro.

<h2 style="letter-spacing: 2px; font-size: 26px;" id="single-cell-RNA-data" >scRNA-seq 10x Genomics RAW and processed data</h2>

A cellular mixture identical to that used for the single-cell proteomics was assessed with scRNA-seq using 10x Genomics Chromium platform and the Single Cell 3’ Library & Gel Bead Kit (v2). Two biological replicates of the cell suspension (stock concentration: 1200 cells/μl) were loaded into independent lanes of the device. An average number of about 10,000 cells/lane were recovered. Following the library preparation and sample QC by Agilent BioAnalyzer High Sensitivity chip, the two libraries were pooled together, quantified by KAPA Library Quantification kit and sequenced using the Illumina Novaseq 6000 system (Nova S1 100 flow cell) with the following run parameters: Read1: 26 cycles, i7 index: 8 cycles, Read2: 93 cycles.

## nano ProteOmic sample Preparation (nPOP)

&nbsp;

Mass spectrometry methods have enabled quantifying thousands of proteins at the single cell level. These methods open the door to tackling many biological challenges, such as characterizing heterogeneity in the tumor micro-environment and better understanding signaling pathways driving stem cell differentiation. To further advance single-cell MS analysis, we developed an automated nano-ProteOmic sample Preparation (nPOP).

## Abstract

Mass spectrometry methods have enabled quantifying thousands of proteins at the single cell level. These methods open the door to tackling many biological challenges, such as characterizing heterogeneity in the tumor micro-environment and better understanding signaling pathways driving stem cell differentiation. To further advance single-cell MS analysis, we developed an automated nano-ProteOmic sample Preparation (nPOP). nPOP isolates individual cells in 300 picoliter volumes and performs all subsequent preparation steps in small droplets on a hydrophobic glass slide, which allows to keep sample volumes below 15 nl.

## About the project

This project on characterizing the isobaric carrier was conducted in the [Slavov Laboratory](https://slavovlab.net) and [SCP Center](https://center.single-cell.net) at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/), and was authored by [Harrison Specht](http://harrisonspecht.com) and [Nikolai Slavov](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/slavov-nikolai/). Learn more about [single-cell mass-spectrometry analysis](https://scope2.slavovlab.net/mass-spec/single-cell-proteomics).  


This project was supported by funding from the [NIH Director's Award](https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=9167004&icde=31336575).

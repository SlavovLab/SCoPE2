## Abstract

A major limitation to applying quantitative LC-MS/MS proteomics to small samples, such as single cells, are the losses incurred during sample cleanup. To relieve this limitation, we developed a Minimal ProteOmic sample Preparation (mPOP) method for culture-grown mammalian cells. mPOP obviates cleanup and thus eliminates cleanup-related losses while expediting sample preparation and simplifying its automation. Bulk SILAC samples processed by mPOP or by conventional urea-based methods indicated that mPOP results in complete cell lysis and accurate relative quantification. mPOP can be easily intergraded with the Single Cell ProtEomics by Mass Spectrometry (SCoPE-MS) and with its second generation SCoPE2 as described in this [protocol](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.12.435034v1).

## About the project

This project on characterizing the isobaric carrier was conducted in the [Slavov Laboratory](https://slavovlab.net) and [SCP Center](https://center.single-cell.net) at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/), and was authored by [Harrison Specht](http://harrisonspecht.com) and [Nikolai Slavov](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/slavov-nikolai/).

This project was supported by funding from the [NIH Director's Award](https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=9167004&icde=31336575).

------------



The sensitivity of mass spectrometry analysis depends on many factors, including sample preprations, data aquision, and data interpretaion. These factors can be benchmarked and optimized by methods developed in the [Slavov Laboratory](http://slavovlab.net):

* [Data-driven Alignment of Retention Times for IDentification (DART-ID)](https://dart-id.slavovlab.net)
* [Data-driven Optimization of Mass-Spectrometry (DO-MS)](https://do-ms.slavovlab.net)

These methods are major contributors to the increased throughput and quantitative accuracy of SCoPE2 compared to [Single-Cell ProtEomics by Mass Spectrometry (SCoPE-MS)](http://slavovlab.net/2016_SCoPE-MS/index.html).

# Prioritized single-cell proteomics

&nbsp;

Prioritized single-cell proteomics was developed by [Huffman et al, 2022][pSCoPE_Preprint]. [pSCoPE](https://scp.slavovlab.net/pSCoPE) allows ensures duty-cycle time for analyzing prioritized peptides across all single cells (thus increasing data consistency) while analyzing identifiable peptides at full duty-cycle, thus increasing proteome depth. These strategies increased the quantified data points for challenging peptides and the overall proteome coverage about 2-fold.

## Implementation
pSCoPE is implemented as a module of MaxQuant.Live, starting with [version 2.1](http://www.maxquant.live) and is compatible with all Orbitrap instruments. All additional code needed for pSCoPE and reproducing [Huffman et al., 2022][pSCoPE_Preprint] is available at [github.com/SlavovLab/pSCoPE](https://github.com/SlavovLab/pSCoPE).

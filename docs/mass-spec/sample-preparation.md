# Sample preparation for single-cell proteomics

&nbsp;

High accuracy and throughput of single-cell proteomics begin with efficient and [automated sample preparation](https://sample-prep.slavovlab.net/). The pages of this section summarize methods that use solely MS-compatible reagents and allow parallel preparation of hundreds of single cells in small volumes:

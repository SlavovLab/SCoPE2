# SCoPE2 protocol

&nbsp;

Many biological systems are composed of diverse single cells. This diversity necessitates functional and molecular single-cell analysis. Single-cell protein analysis has long relied on affinity reagents, but emerging mass-spectrometry methods (either label-free or multiplexed) have enabled quantifying over 1,000 proteins per cell while simultaneously increasing the specificity of protein quantification. Isobaric carrier based multiplexed single-cell proteomics is a scalable, reliable, and cost-effective method that can be fully automated and implemented on widely available equipment. It uses inexpensive reagents and is applicable to any sample that can be processed to a single-cell suspension. Here we describe an automated SCoPE2 workflow that allows analyzing about 200 single cells per 24 hours using only standard commercial equipment.
